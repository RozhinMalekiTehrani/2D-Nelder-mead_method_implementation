## 2D Nelder-mead algorithm implementation and visualization

The Nelder-Mead method is a heuristic optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function without using derivative information. It is a direct search method that iteratively explores the function space by manipulating a simplex, a geometrical shape defined by a set of points. 
In this file of code, I am implementing 2D Nelder-mead method and visualize each procedure (like shrinkage) to shed a light on its proccess.
